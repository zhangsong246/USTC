And the service only provides the reference price. The existing problem is that the courier operations are not standardized, user experience is poor, no deterministic service quality is ensure and the system scalability is not high.
To solve these problems of the end service for sending, this subject conducts the full investigation of the needs for sending and the detailed analysis of the business, and adopts the Spring framework, the microservice architecture and the existing middleware platform to design the overall system architecture and builds a complete processing system for sending order. 
This processing system of this subject implements the online and off-line business collaboration between couriers and consumers, production and performance of logistics tasks of sending, display of the tracking logistics information, connection of the mobile application, configuration of the operational activities and other functions.
This subject deploys the system in the production environment, designs and completes the assessment of the system's quality. And this subject makes the system read the target of providing the stable treatment of visits which reaches a certain size, the reliable service of deterministic time and price and the flexible scalability of end business.
